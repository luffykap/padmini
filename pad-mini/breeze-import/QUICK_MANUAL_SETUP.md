## 🎯 **Minimal Setup (10 minutes)**

If you just need to start tracking NOW:

### **Create 3 Simple Lists:**

1. **🔄 Current Sprint** (this week's work)
   - Add 3-5 tasks you're working on RIGHT NOW
   
2. **✅ Completed** (what's done)
   - Add major features already built
   - Feels good to see progress!

3. **📋 Backlog** (future work)
   - Add planned features
   - Prioritize later

### **Add Today's Tasks:**

```
Current Sprint:
□ Fix Firebase rate limit issue
□ Update Firestore security rules
□ Test verification bypass
□ Deploy to production Firebase
□ Create deployment documentation
```

## 📱 **Use Breeze Mobile App**

While setting up:
1. Download Breeze app on your phone
2. Log in
3. Add quick tasks on the go
4. Check them off as you complete

---

## 🔄 **Incremental Setup Strategy**

**Don't try to add all 60+ tasks at once!**

**Week 1:** Add current sprint tasks only (5-10 tasks)
**Week 2:** Add deployment tasks (5-10 tasks)
**Week 3:** Add enhancement backlog (10-15 tasks)
**Ongoing:** Add tasks as needed

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **1. Use Task Templates**
Create a template task with standard fields:
- Description format
- Standard tags
- Time estimates
- Then duplicate and edit

### **2. Bulk Add via Copy-Paste**
Some Breeze views let you paste multiple task names:
```
Task 1
Task 2
Task 3
```
Then add details one by one.

### **3. Import from GitHub Issues**
If you have GitHub:
- Create issues from CSV
- Link Breeze to GitHub (if supported)
- Import automatically

### **4. Use Keyboard Shortcuts**
- `N` or `+` to add new task (in many project tools)
- `Enter` to save
- Speed up data entry

---

## 📊 **Alternative: Use Trello/Asana Format**

If Breeze setup is too manual, consider:

**Trello:**
- Import CSV directly
- Free with boards
- Export: https://trello.com/

**Asana:**
- CSV import available
- Free for small teams
- Better import features

**Then link to Breeze** via integrations if needed.

   □ Update documentation
   ```

4. **Review daily**
